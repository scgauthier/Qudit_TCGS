The files relevant for the chapter 7 of my MSc thesis "Recurrence Based Purification of Qudit Graph States" are:

1. imperfect_LO.py, which provides the functionality for simulating the protocol with gate errors.

2. utils.py, which provides several utility functions called upon by the simulation procedue, such as functions 
for matching density matrix entries to the label of a graph basis state.

3. weyl_covariant_channel.py, which prepares and saves text files corresponding to depolarized input states. 

The files relevant for chapter 6 of my thesis are:

1. Recurrence_Analysis.py, which numerically calculates the states output by the error-less purification protocol, 
using equations 5.13 and 5.16 from my thesis. It can be used to conduct a study to determine the minimum required input fidelity to achieve purification. 

2. utils.py, providing utility functions

3. weyl_covariant_channel.py, which prepares and saves text files corresponding to depolarized input states.
